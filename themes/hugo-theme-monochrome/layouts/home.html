        I am a postoctoral fellow at the Carnegie Theoretical Astrophysics Center (CTAC) at the Carnegie Observatories. I use MHD simulations to study the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae and the evolution of magnetocentrigugal winds, particularly those of newly born, highly magnetized neutron stars.
